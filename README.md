# portfolio-bootstrap
Revised Portfolio with Bootstrap included

# Description
A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers and it is important for any aspiring web developer to have one. An effective portfolio highlights our strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. It is known that those who have portfolios with deployed web applications are typically very successful in their career search. Therefore, as an aspiring web developer myself (I have a long way to go), I created this webpage application to highlight my recent work and contact details. This challenge projects applies skills I've recently learned, such as flexbox, media queries, CSS variables and bootstrap. This project will be improved in the future as my skillset continues to develop.

Here is a link of the deployed application: https://loishunt.github.io/portfolio-bootstrap
